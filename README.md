# mass-crop
The goal of mass-crop is to have a simple command line program to crop a large number of images to a specified size.
That and due things such as change colors, center based on surrounding whitespace/transparency, etc... I'm also using 
this project as a way to introduce myself to Gradle and JCommander.
